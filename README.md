# i see you stumbled upon my github...

i go by ***fall*** and i'm an economics major at uc davis with an interest in video game development.  

despite being an economics major, i spend most of my time writing code and messing around with various game engines.   
so far, i have used:
- 🐍 pygame
- 🕊 unity
- 🤖 godot
- 👾 arcade

i have also picked up a few languages on the way...  
i can write code in:
- 🐍 python
- 💻 c
- #️⃣ c#
- 🤯 bash
- 🌙 lua
- 🐥 swift

fun fact: i have never taken a single computer science class, probably explains why my profile isn't that impressive...

i'm currently working on recreating don't starve together in 3d using unity. if you have questions or want to contribute, my discord is **fall#0211**
